An indoor walkway allows up-close viewing of the marine animals in these habitats.\n\nFor a family experience, try timing your visit with a scheduled fish feeding time or talk. Children will be delighted to learn more about the sea creatures and play on the interactive displays. The aquarium should be on the top of any list of things to with kids in Sharjah, especially for children’s edutainment. Families in Sharjah often bring kids here to learn about local marine life.\n\nIf you’re planning the aquarium as one of your places to visit in Sharjah at night, make sure to catch the sunset at the beautiful Al Khan beach first. The views here are as beautiful but distinctively different from the Sharjah Corniche. Then, take a quick tour of the aquarium before it closes in the late evening. Your ticket includes entry to the Sharjah Maritime Museum next door, where you can learn about the coast in more detail than any other Sharjah museum. After visiting these destinations, you will have checked off three popular Sharjah tourist places.",

It stretches from the roundabout just after Coral Beach Resort Sharjah to the five-star Kempinski Hotel Ajman. In 2014, the local authorities of Ajman decided to redesign the corniche to create more public spaces and facilities such as a bike path and jogging track for local residents. As part of the redevelopment, they decided to upgrade the lighting of 4 km esplanade as they wanted a more sustainable solution that would reduce the city's energy consumption and environmental footprint.",
